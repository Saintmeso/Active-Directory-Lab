# RAS/NAT


- Installed Remote Access Services and enabled NAT/PAT
- Configured the internal network so that it will use RAT for internet access
- Verified NAT translation by testing internet access, browsing external websites from within the internal clients

RAS/NAT installed on the DC, so that the Windows 10 client can be on this private virtual network, but still be able to access the internet through the Domain Controller

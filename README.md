# Active-Directory-Lab
I set up a lab to mirror a small-scale corporate Active Directory environment using Windows Server and related network services. Running in VMware Workstation, the setup includes a Windows Server acting as the domain controller and a Windows 10 client machine. Active Directory, DNS, DHCP, and RAS for NAT are fully configured, with PowerShell scripts added to automate common administrative tasks and streamline management.

Tools:
- VMware Workstation: Virtual Environment
- Windows Server 2019: Domain Controller
- Windows 10: Client User
- Active Directory Users & Computers: User and Admin group management 
- Powershell: Script for 1000 user creation

Practical Experience:
- Network configuration: NAT, PAT, IP subnetting
- Familiarity with PowerShell scripting
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) with AD
- DNS troubleshooring: forward/reverse lookups, ping testing
- DHCP scope creation, lease troubleshooting
- Connectivity testing
